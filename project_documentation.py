Program Purpose: Create a median filter using Python library PIL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~~~The Class~~~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I made the class so that the program could be a little more coherent and
    dynamic. Typically, classes are made so that changes could be made easily
    without being too tedious. In my case, I did it just to practice coding
    modularly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
~~~The Init Function~~~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In this function, I initialized several variable that correspond to 
    dimensions of the pictures. This way, any list of files that is passed
    through the class is generalized and easy to reuse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
~~~The ImagesRGB Function~~~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Primarily, I opened and loaded all the files. I couldn't really make 
    this very modular, so I hardcoded it instead where I have an idea of the 
    length of the list, and that the images are sorted. This leaves room for 
    ambiguity as well as some knowledge of what is happening. I use list 
    comprehension to put a list of lists of RGB values where each sublist
    represents a pixel, and each sublist contains 9 RGB tuples, representative
    of each image. I then return the big list.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~~~The PixelAverage Function~~~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    First, I called the ImagesRGB function so that I can use the list of rgb
    values. Then I initialized an empty list called "rgb_average" which will be
    used to store all median rgb values for every pixel. I have a nested for
    loop that first loops through all lists of rgb values, then loops through
    each tuple in the list.  Each sublist corresponds to the pixel coordinates.
    In the first loop, I initialized 3 lists: r,g, and b, which will all be 
    reset after the tuples in each list are evaluated. In the second loop,
    I append each value of each tuple into seperate lists. The lists are then
    sorted, and I grab the "median" of each list and create a tuple from each
    list into the rgb_average list. I then return the list to be used.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~~~The MakePicture Function~~~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In this function, I called the PixelAverage function, then initialized a
    new image, using PIL's Image class.  I then put all the rgb data into the 
    empty image, because the rgb data was evaluated by row, it all works out
    fine.  I then save the image as a new file. Voila! It is done.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~~~Outisde Of The Class~~~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Outisde of the class, I used a for loop to get all of the files in the 
    current directory and appended them all in a list to be used in the class
    call. This assumes that all files are "png" and the name begins with a 
    number.
